Building on Windows

1) Install Java 7 JDK.  This is required for running the application as well as building it

set your JAVA_HOME to the new JDK root directory.  You can do this either in the System Control panel for the whole system
or do it in a single terminal window. 

eg. for a cmd window

set JAVA_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_40

2) set up Maven
